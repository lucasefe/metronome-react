## Just a Metronome

Built with React, because I'm tired of learning JS frameworks with TODO lists. 

### Roadmap

- [ ] Better sounds
- [ ] Visual grid that shows what's playing. 
- [ ] Button to enable only sound, or only visual.
- [ ] The slider is ugly. We need a wheel. 
- [ ] Available somewhere.
